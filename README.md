# algorithm_visualiser
A C++ project that uses OpenGL & CMake to show how algorithms work under the hood 

## How to Run:
1. Click on the button " <> Code " and copy the url.


2. Clone the repository to your system locally by opening up your terminal:

    ```
    cd Desktop/
    git clone {url} 
    ```
3. Move into the "build" directory and run the programme:

    ```
    cd algorithm_visualiser
    cd build
    ./algorithm visualiser
    ```
I'll add more algorithms later on but probably won't write the Windows commands.
